#Sorting

#Selection Sort
# Find minimum element in list, move it to the front
# then sort the remaining list the same way


# Merge Sort
# Divide your array into two halves, sort each, then merge them


# Bubble Sort
#Create a bubble with two adjacent elements in a list - 1,2 2,3 3,4 etc.
# if they are not sorted, sort the bubble and move to the next bubble
# keep going till list is sorted.

# Insertion Sort
# Iterate over the array. If the current value is less than the value to it's left, keep moving it left till it's at the right place.

# Quick Sort
# Pick a random pivot. Partition the array into two halves, items smal;ler than the pivot go to the left, larger than the pivot go to the right
# Sort each individual halves.
# Then do it in the same array
