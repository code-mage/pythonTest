# Lesson Plan

## Day 1

1. [X] Setup environment
2. [X] Python 2 vs Python 3
3. [X] Program on command line - Hello World
4. [X] IDE
5. [X] Basics - Interpreter etc.
6. [X] Setup Git
7. [X] Print Hello World and run file
8. [X] Variable Basics
9. [X] Comments
10. [X] Debug

TODO

1. [X] print without newlines.
2. [X] print multiple variables in the same statement
3. [X] Print multiple variables in the same statement separated by a "-"
4. [X] swap variables. if you have a and b with two values, put a's value in b and b's value in a

## Day 2

1. [X] Go over TODOs
2. [X] input()
3. [X] variable types
4. [X] input typecasting
5. [X] Play around with string (collection of char), int, bool and float - basics
6. [X] Introduce operators (+-* ><= andOrNot) - Focus on ==, division (// for int vs / for float)

TODO

1. [ ] Multiple inputs from the same line
2. [ ] Write XOR using only AND and OR (pretty useless for learning the language. Just want to see if you can.)
3. [ ] Easy - Say I have 4 variables each with a single digit number a=1 b=2 c=3 d=4, I want to get an answer to 12*34.
4. [ ] Try to implement 1 as a log division solution3.

## Day 3

1. [ ] Complicated operators - += -= %
2. [ ] String and int add and parsing
3. [ ] Complicating string - \n, escaping quotes, format (from string import Template, do not use),
4. [ ] Split a string,
5. [ ] == vs is (concept of pointers)
6. [ ] type() function
7. [ ] import math or import operator

TODO

1. [ ] Difficult - Convert base 10 to binary - as in 27 to 11011 - There are direct solutions available on the internet, don't use them, just give it a shot
2. [ ] Write a basic file with datetime variables - display current time, what time will it be after 4 hours have passed etc .
3. [ ] Moderate difficulty - can you write in a user friendly way if after/before a certain amount of time has passed, will it be - Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, or neither.

## Day 4

1. [ ] If conditions
2. [ ] Loops - while, for, foreach
3. [ ] Nested loops
4. [ ] Python indentation
5. [ ] break and continue
6. [ ] Lists for loops - Introduce - get value at index, length, start at 0,
7. [ ] Any, All, In operators

TODO

1. [ ] Print only odd values in an array
2. [ ] find common values between two arrays
3. [ ] find max value in an array
4. [ ] Using 3, can you sort an array. O(n^2) will be revisited.
5. [ ] Given an array, can you find it it is sorted.
6. [ ] Using long division you tried earlier, can you multiple two array of numbers [2,1,3]_[2,5,6,8,9] = 213_25689

## Day 5

1. String as lists
2. Splicing strings and arrays
3. change list items
4. Add list items (append, insert, extend), remove list items(remove, pop)
5. Join lists
6. Copy lists
7. Find, Replace in string.
8. List within a list
9. [List methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_methods.asp)

TODO

1. Reverse a string.
2. Check if string is a palindrome
3. Merge two sorted lists - Remember this. Will be useful later.
4. Remove duplicates from sorted list - Will be revisited.
5. Matrix multiplication
6. [Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)

## Day 6

1. Tuples
2. Dictionary
3. Sets

TODO

1. Reverse the Tuple - There are two ways to do this - a direct function and a loop through a tuple
2. Count the number of times a value appears in a Tuple
3. Create mirror image of a string - a replaced with z, b with y etc.
4. In last TODO, we tried to find common values between two lists. Can you simply that using sets.
5. Given a list of integers, check if any two add up to a given number. (Must only loop through the list once)
6. Given a list, find the second most repeated word in it (Must only loop through the list once)

## Day 7

1. File I/O
2. Exception Handling

TODO
1. Take user input as two numbers and add them. Handle incorrect input provided by the user.
2. Download [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NdVS_nkgSpAL3vQ8k-HX1NHaRHMETjU3/view?usp=drivesdk) file. Try to use DateTime, string splits and readfile to calculate how many messages we've sent to each other.  And in how many do you use "...". And if the frequency is decreasing.
